== I Am Using GitHub Under Protest ==

Please consider my Codeberg instead: [https://codeberg.org/ashistry](https://codeberg.org/ashistry)
I currently host on github.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop FOSS projects. I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of my code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of my code in Copilot.
